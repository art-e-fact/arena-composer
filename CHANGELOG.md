# Changelog

What changed for someone using arena-composer: the `arena-*` commands, the editor panel, the MCP
tools. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are
the wheel's, from `Cargo.toml`, and each is a GitHub Release whose notes are its section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The editor panel shows the background, object sets, object references and the task — its
  description, its composition and a card per subtask — where it showed only the robot, the
  objects and the relations.
- The asset browser shows each asset as a card: its picture, name, whether it is registered with
  Arena or a SimReady prop, its physics type, its tags, and how many the scene already holds. Drag
  a card from anywhere on it.

### Changed

- Every entry in the editor panel is a card, after Blender's modifier stack: it folds, its header
  names it, and its × removes it. A folded card sums up its entry beside the name, and an object's
  card shows its asset's picture.
- An id is renamed by typing into its card's header, where it took a double-click on the name.
- Renaming the robot's or the background's id renames the relations and task params naming it too,
  as renaming an object does.
- Switching the background's asset drops the params the new one does not take, as switching the
  robot does.
- Adding a second subtask to an `atomic` task makes it `sequential`, and removing back down to one
  makes it `atomic`, so the task stays valid at each step.

### Fixed

- A number typed into the editor panel was saved even when escaped from, and saved twice when
  entered.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Pick the robot in the editor panel, from the registered embodiments, and over MCP with
  `set_embodiment`. The robot's id stays, and the params the new one does not take are dropped.

### Fixed

- A spec naming something other than a robot as its embodiment is refused when edited, rather than
  failing when the scene is built.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- The first release on its own: `arena-view`, `arena-resolve-layout`, `arena-mcp` and
  `arena-composer init`, as a manylinux wheel attached to the GitHub Release.
